  <h1 class="main-text"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT: </strong><small>The mission of the Positive Action Group is to
   act positively to help our school and our community. We pledge to be positive and
   never negative, because negative actions are worse than no actions at all. We look forward
   to a fantastic year of helping.</small></h1>
   <h1 class="secondary-text"><strong>MEET CAMERON BOXER, P.A.G. PRESIDENT: </strong><small>Cam
   is an eighth grader at Sycamore Middle School. He got the idea for the Positive Action Group when he noticed
   that all the other clubs were about games or sports or activities, but none of them were about helping. And so,
   the P.A.G. was born.</small></h1>
